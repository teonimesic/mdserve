## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Serve a single markdown file on default port (3000)
mdserve README.md

# Serve all markdown files in a directory
mdserve docs/

# Serve on custom port
mdserve README.md --port 8080
mdserve docs/ -p 8080

# Serve on custom hostname and port
mdserve README.md --hostname 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

### Single-File vs Directory Mode

**Single-File Mode**: When you pass a file path, mdserve serves that specific markdown file with a clean, focused view.

**Directory Mode**: When you pass a directory path, mdserve automatically:
- Scans and serves all `.md` and `.markdown` files in that directory
- Displays a navigation sidebar for easy switching between files
- Watches for new markdown files added to the directory
- Only monitors the immediate directory (non-recursive)


## Endpoints

Once running, the server provides (default: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)):

- **[`/`](http://localhost:3000/)** - Rendered HTML with live reload via WebSocket
- **[`/ws`](http://localhost:3000/ws)** - WebSocket endpoint for real-time updates
