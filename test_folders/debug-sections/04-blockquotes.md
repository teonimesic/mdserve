# Blockquotes

> This is a simple blockquote.

> This is a multi-line blockquote.
> It spans multiple lines.
> And continues here.

> Nested blockquotes:
> > This is nested once
> > > This is nested twice
> > > > And this is nested three times

> **Note:** You can use other markdown inside blockquotes
> - Like lists
> - And `inline code`
>
> ```javascript
> // And even code blocks
> console.log("Hello from blockquote");
> ```
